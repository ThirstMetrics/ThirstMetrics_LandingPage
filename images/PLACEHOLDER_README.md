## Placeholder Strategy

During development each path contains a minimal SVG placeholder (even files with
`.jpg` or `.png` extensions). These SVGs render a colored rectangle with the
image name centered in white text so missing assets are immediately obvious in
the browser.

**Before deploying to production**, replace every file with real photography at
the dimensions listed above and ensure formats match the extension (.jpg for
photos, .png for screenshots).
